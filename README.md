# Project Title

FindThisMovie

## Description

Have you ever wanted to stream or rent a movie but had no idea which of the dozens of streaming platforms had it available? That's the problem that this project set out to solve. 

A simple way to find where you can watch your favorite movies.

This is my first project putting together all I have learned as it relates to JS, HTML, and CSS over the past three months.

Although this project was meant as a way to simply reinforce educational concepts I hope you find it helps you during your next movie night :)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Aside from the app.js, index.html, and styles.css files you will require an API Token from The Movie Database (TMDB). Additional information on TMDB and their API can be found below:

For instructions on how to register for an API token with TMBD see the introduction they outline [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).
