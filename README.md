# Project Title

FindThisMovie

## Description

Have you ever wanted to stream or rent a movie but had no idea which of the dozens of streaming platforms had it available? That's the problem that this project set out to solve. 

A simple way to find where you can watch your favorite movies and shows.

This is my first project putting together all I have learned as it relates to JS, HTML, and CSS over the past three months.

Although this project was meant as a way to simply reinforce educational concepts I hope you find it helps you during your next movie night :)
